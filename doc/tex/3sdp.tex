In semidefinite programing we try to maximize a linear function, such that an affine combination of symmetric matrices is positive semidefinite. \cite{vandenberghe96}
An affine combination is a linear combination \[
\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_ix_i
.\] where $x_i$ are elements of a vector space, such that $\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i=1$
Semidefinite programs are very useful, as they can be solved efficiently both in theory and in practice.
In our case, the semidefinite program is:
\[
maximize tr\left( CM \right)
s.t. \begin{align}
	\label{eq:}
M_{i,i} = 1 \
M \ge 0
\end{align}
.\]
where M is a real symmetric matrix.
This is without loss of generality, as it does not change the outcome of the objective function. \todo{thats not the only reason we can do this}
The ideal solution $M$ is connected to our state in the following way:\cite{gharibian19}
\[
	M_{i,j} = tr\left( \rho P_{i}P_j \right) ~ i,j=1\ldots 3n
.\]
From this perspective. the constraints can be understood in the following way:
$$M_{i,i}=tr\left( \rho P_i P_i\right) = tr\left( \rho\right) = 1  $ since $P_iP_i=1\\
M\ge 0\leftrightarrow x^TMx=tr\left( \rho\left(\sum_{i}^{3n} x_iP_i\right)\left(\sum_{j}^{3n} x_jP_j right)\right)=tr\left(\rho X^2\right)\ge 0$ where $X=\sum_{i}^{3n} x_iP_i$ and since $X^2,\rho\ge 0$$
