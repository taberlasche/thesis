In our case, the semidefinite program is:
\[
maximize tr\left( CM \right)
s.t. \begin{align}
	\label{eq:}
M_{i,i} = 1 \
M \ge 0
\end{align}
.\]
where M is a real symmetric matrix.
This is without loss of generality, as it does not change the outcome of the objective function. \todo{thats not the only reason we can do this}
The ideal solution $M$ is connected to our state in the following way:\cite{gharibian19}
\[
	M_{i,j} = tr\left( \rho P_{i}P_j \right) ~ i,j=1\ldots 3n
.\]
From this perspective. the constraints can be understood in the following way:\
$M_{i,i}=tr\left( \rho P_i P_i\right) = tr\left( \rho\right) = 1  $ since $P_iP_i=1$\
