Approximating quantum systems with product states is a relevant method to several fields.
In chemistry, it is called the Hartree-Fock method, in quantum many-body physics we call it mean-field theory.
It is successful in approximating a solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation of atoms, molecules and nanostructures \cite{abdulsattar12}.
